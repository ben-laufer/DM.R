## Overview

The goal of `DMRichR` is to make the comprehensive statistical analysis of whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data accessible to the larger epigenomics community, so that it no longer remains a niche methodology. Whether it be peripheral samples from a large-scale human epidemiological study or a select set of precious samples from model and non-model organisms, WGBS can provide novel insight into the epigenome and its role in the regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, the functions and workflow are written with the goal of bridging the gap for those transitioning from Illumina's Infinium assay technology (450K and EPIC arrays) by providing statistical analysis and visualization functions that present the data in a familiar format. 

The overarching theme of `DMRichR` is the synthesis of popular [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org) R packages for the analysis of genomic data with the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) philosophy of R programming. This allows for a streamlined and tidy approach for downstream data analysis and visualization. In addition to functioning as an R package, the central component of DMRichR is an [executable script](exec/DM.R) that is meant to be run as a single call from command line. While this is a non-traditional approach for R programming, it serves as a novel piece of software that simplifies the analysis process while also providing a backbone to build custom workflows on (in a manner similar to a traditional vignette).

`DMRichR` leverages the statistical algorithms from two popular R packages,`dmrseq` and `bsseq`, which enable the inference of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) from low coverage WGBS. In these smoothing based approaches, CpG sites with higher coverage are given a higher weight and used to infer the methylation level of neighboring CpGs with lower coverage. This approach favors a larger sample size over a deeper sequencing depth, and only requires between 1-5x coverage for each sample. By focusing on the differences in methylation levels between groups, rather than the absolute levels within a group, the methodologies utilized allow for a low coverage WGBS approach that assays ~10x more of the genome for only around ~2x the price of competing reduced representation methods (i.e. arrays and RRBS). In our experience, it is these unexplored regions of the genome that contain the most informative results for studies outside of the cancer research domain; however, these regions should also provide novel insight for cancer researchers as well. In order to facilitate an understanding of these DMRs and global methylation levels, `DMRichR` also works as a traditional R package with a number of downstream functions for statistical analysis and data visualization that can be viewed in the [R folder](R/). 

A single command line call performs the following steps:

## DMR Approach and Interpretation

The main statistical approach applied by the [executable script](exec/DM.R) located in the `exec` folder is `dmrseq::dmrseq()`, which identifies DMRs in a two step approach:
 
1. DMR Detection: The differences in CpG methylation for the effect of interest are pooled and smoothed to give CpG sites with higher coverage a higher weight, and candidate DMRs with a difference between groups are assembled.
2. Statistical Analysis: A region statistic for each DMR, which is comparable across the genome, is estimated via the application of a generalized least squares (GLS) regression model with a nested autoregressive correlated error structure for the effect of interest. Then, permutation testing of a pooled null distribution enables the identification of significant DMRs. This approach accounts for both inter-individual and inter-CpG variability across the entire genome.
 
The main estimate of a difference in methylation between groups is not a fold change but rather a beta coefficient, which is representative of the average [effect size](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/documents/00002182.htm); however, it is on the scale of the [arcsine transformed differences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29481604) and must be divided by π (3.14) to be similar to the mean methylation difference over a DMR, which is provided in the `percentDifference` column. Since the testing is permutation based, it provides empirical p-values as well as FDR corrected q-values.

One of the key differences between `dmrseq` and other DMR identification packages, like `bsseq`, is that `dmrseq` is performing statistical testing on the DMRs themselves rather than testing for differences in single CpGs that are then assembled into DMRs like `bsseq::dmrFinder()` does. This unique approach helps with controlling the false discovery rate and testing the correlated nature of CpG sites in a regulatory region, while also enabling complex experimental designs. However, since `dmrseq::dmrseq()` does not provide individual smoothed methylation values, `bsseq::BSmooth()` is utlized to generate individual smoothed methylation values from the DMRs. Therefore, while the DMRs themselves are adjusted for covariates, the indvidual smoothed methylation values for these DMRs are not adjusted for covaraites.

You can also read my general summary of the drmseq approach on [EpiGenie](https://epigenie.com/dmrseq-powers-whole-genome-bisulfite-sequencing-analysis/).

Each dot represents the methylation level of an individual CpG in a single sample, where the size of the dot is representative of coverage. The lines represent smoothed methylation levels for each sample, either control (blue) or DS (red). Genic and CpG annotations are shown below the plot.

## Installation

No manual installation of R packages is required, since the required packages and updates will occur automatically upon running the [executable script](exec/DM.R) located in the `exec` folder. However, the package does require Bioconductor, which you can install or update to using:

```
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(version = "3.10")
```

Additionally, if you are interested in creating your own workflow as opposed to using the executable script, you can download the package using:

`BiocManager::install(c("remotes", "ben-laufer/DMRichR"))`

## The Design Matrix and Covariates

This script requires a basic design matrix to identify the groups and covariates, which should be named `sample_info.xlsx` and contain header columns to identify the factor. It is important to have the label for the experimental samples start with a letter in the alphabet that comes after the one used for control samples in order to obtain results for experimental vs. control rather than control vs. experimental. You can select which specific samples to analyze from the working directory through the design matrix, where pattern matching of the sample name will only select bismark cytosine report files with a matching name before the first underscore, which also means that sample names should not contain underscores. Within the script, covariates can be selected for adjustment. There are two different ways to adjust for covariates: directly adjust values or balance permutations.


| Name          | Diagnosis      | Age           |  Sex          |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| SRR3537014    | Idiopathic_ASD | 14            | M             |
| SRR3536981    | Control        | 42            | F             |


## Input

Before running the executable, ensure you have the following project directory tree structure for the [Bismark cytosine reports](https://github.com/ben-laufer/CpG_Me) and design matrix:

```
├── Project
│   ├── cytosine_reports
│   │   ├── sample1_bismark_bt2.deduplicated.bismark.cov.gz.CpG_report.txt.gz
│   │   ├── sample2_bismark_bt2.deduplicated.bismark.cov.gz.CpG_report.txt.gz
│   │   ├── sample_info.xlsx
```

This workflow requires the following variables:
1. `-g --genome` Select either: hg38, mm10, rn6, or rheMac8.
2. `-x --coverage` CpG coverage cutoff for all samples, 1x is the default and minimum value.
3. `-s --perGroup` Percent of samples per a group for CpG coverage cutoff, values range from 0 to 1, 1 (100%) is the default.
4. `-m --minCpGs` Minimum number of CpGs for a DMR, 5 is default.
5. `-p --maxPerms` Number of permutations for DMR and block analyses, 10 is default.
6. `-o --cutoff` The cutoff value for the single CpG coefficient utilized to discover testable background regions, values range from 0 to 1, 0.05 (5%) is the default.
7. `-t --testCovariate` Covariate to test for significant differences between experimental and control, i.e. Diagnosis.
8. `-a --adjustCovariate` Adjust covariates that are continuous or contain two or more factor groups, i.e. "Age". More than one covariate can be adjusted for using single brackets and the `;` delimiter, i.e. `'Sex;Age'`
9. `-m --matchCovariate` Covariate to balance permutations, which is meant for two-group factor covariates in small sample sizes in order to prevent extremely unbalanced permutations. Only one two-group factor can be balanced, i.e. Sex. Note: This will not work for larger sample sizes (> 500,000 permutations) and is not needed for them as the odds of sampling an extremely unbalanced permutation for a covariate decreases with increasing sample size. Futhermore, we generally do not use this in our analyses, since we prefer to directly adjust for sex. 
10. `-c --cores` The number of cores to use, 20 is recommended but you can go as low as 1, 8 is the default.

#### Generic Example

Below is an example of how to execute the [main R script (DM.R)](exec/DM.R) in the `exec` folder on command line. This should be called from the working directory that contains the cytosine reports.

```
call="Rscript \
--vanilla \
/share/lasallelab/programs/DMRichR/DM.R \
--genome hg38 \
--coverage 1 \
--perGroup '1' \
--minCpGs 5 \
--maxPerms 10 \
--cutoff '0.05' \
--testCovariate Diagnosis \
--adjustCovariate 'Sex;Age' \
--cores 20"

echo $call
eval $call
```

#### UC Davis Example

If you are using the Barbera cluster at UC Davis, the following commands can be used to execute `DM.R` from your login node (i.e. epigenerate), where `htop` should be called first to make sure the whole node is available. This should be called from the working directory that contains the cytosine reports and **not** from within a `screen`.

```
module load R/3.6.1 

call="nohup \
Rscript \
--vanilla \
/share/lasallelab/programs/DMRichR/DM.R \
--genome hg38 \
--coverage 1 \
--perGroup '1' \
--minCpGs 5 \
--maxPerms 10 \
--cutoff '0.05' \
--testCovariate Diagnosis \
--adjustCovariate 'Sex;Age' \
--cores 60 \
> DMRichR.log 2>&1 &"

echo $call
eval $call 
echo $! > save_pid.txt
```

You can then check on the job using `tail -f DMRichR.log` and <kbd>⌃ Control</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> to exit the log view. 
You can cancel the job from the project directory using `cat save_pid.txt | xargs kill`. You can also check your running jobs using `ps -ef | grep `, which should be followed by your username i.e. `ps -ef | grep blaufer`. Finally, if you still see leftover processes in htop, you can cancel all your processes using `pkill -u`, which should be followed by your username i.e. `pkill -u blaufer`.

Alternatively, the executable can also be submitted to the cluster using the [shell script](exec/DM.R.sh) via `sbatch DM.R.sh`.
